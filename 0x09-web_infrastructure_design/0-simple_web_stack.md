ISSUES

SPOF (Single point of failure)
- If mySQL server goes down the entire site would be down

Downtime when maintenance needed
- When running maintenance the server would have to be turned off, since there is only one server the website would experience downtime

Cannot scale if theres too much incoming traffic
- It will be hard to scale this infrastructure because only one server has the required components. The server can run out of resources or slow down when recieving alot of requests.
